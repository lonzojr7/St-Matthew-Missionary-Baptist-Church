                <p>
                    Pastor Lonzo L. Hamilton Sr. was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
                    He accepted Christ as his personal savior in 1977. 
                    He was baptized by the late Reverend Dr. AP Clay at the Little Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Kenner, Louisiana.
                    He accepted his call to the ministry in 1990. Pastor Hamilton was licensed to preach in 1990 and was ordained in 1992
                    at Little Zion Missionary Baptist Church. He attended Christian Bible College of Louisiana, where he received a Doctorate
                    Degree in Theology in 1995. Pastor Hamilton has taught at Christian and Maranatha Bible Collges. He was a Street Evangelist 
                    for 10 years.

                    He began fellowship at St. Matthews Missionary Baptsit Church in 1999 under the pastoral leadership of the late 
                    Reverend Edward Brown. 
                    He was installed as Pastor of St. Matthew on October 1, 2004, after the retirement of Reverend Brown.

                    Under his leadership, the first Marriage Institute, Sunday School Department, 
                    and Youth Sunmmer Vacation Trip to Disney World were established. He acquired Church management 
                    and Tax Law information, securing a 501C3 status for the Church. He continues to provide unlimited guidance support 
                    in the restoration of our church during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina

                    Pastor Hamilton has been quite busy for the Lord during these twenty-one years of service at St. Matthews.
                    He has ministered to his flock providing all types of services such as christenings, weddings, burials, baptisms, etc.
                    Under his administration, the church has been able to increase its spiriitual and financial status.
                    St. Matthews has been able to reach out to the community and provide assistance to those in need through street ministry.
                    We purchased a parking lot, began the use of percussion and string instruments in worship services, and
                    established a Media Ministry. On November 9, 2012, Pastor Hamilton ordained Reverend Robert Chandler Jr. into the ministry 
                    , and he appointed two deaconesses. In late 2018, the construction began on the new extended addition,
                    which included a disabled ramp that leads into the sanctuary, with added parking for the congregation. 
                    On March 17, 2019, Pastor Hamilton led the march along with St. Matthews' members
