        <h1> What We Believe </h1>
        <section class="What-we-believe">
        <p> 
            At St. Matthew Missionary Baptist Church, our faith is rooted in the Word of God and centered on Jesus Christ. 
            We believe the Bible is the foundation for our faith, our teaching, and our daily living.
            We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, divinely inspired and without error. It reveals God's truth, His will for humanity, and His plan of salvation. The Bible has God as its Author and serves as our final authority in matters of faith and practice.
            We believe in one faith, one Lord, and one baptism. We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins and rose again so that all who believe in Him may have eternal life.
            We believe in the security of the believer, trusting that salvation is a gift from God and that those who place their faith in Jesus Christ are kept by His grace and power.
            We believe in the return of Jesus Christ. We believe in the rapture of the church and in the second coming of Christ, when He will return in glory to fulfill God's promises and establish His eternal kingdom.
            Our beliefs guide how we worship, serve, and love others. We strive to live out our faith through prayer, discipleship, and service to our community, always seeking to glorify God in all that we do.
            We welcome all who desire to grow in faith and experience the love of Christ.

            <h3>Church Overview</h3>
            <p>
                St. Matthew Missionary Baptist Church was founded in 1935 
                through the vision and obedience of Rev. Robert G. Glasper, 
                who was moved by the Spirit of God to organize a church grounded 
                in faith and service. Working alongside a council of ministers, 
                St. Matthew was officially organized on May 10, 1935, in accordance 
                with the Standard Manual for Baptist Churches. After years of prayer and dedication, 
                the church was blessed in 1943 with a permanent place of worship at 1826 Conti Street 
                in New Orleans. Rev. Glasper served faithfully as pastor until his passing on March 21, 1961, 
                during which time the church grew spiritually and became a source of guidance and inspiration in the community.
            </p>

            <p>
                In August 1961, Rev. Edward Brown was elected pastor. 
                Under his leadership, the church experienced significant 
                spiritual and financial growth. Many members were added through 
                baptism, and the church expanded its ministries through counseling, 
                ordinations, and community outreach. 
                In 1970, St. Matthew was blessed with the construction of a new building, 
                and by December 1978, the church became debt-free. Additional property 
                adjacent to the church was later acquired, strengthening the church's foundation and presence. 
                Rev. Brown was named Pastor Emeritus in 2004, and his prayers and guidance continued even after Hurricane Katrina.
            </p>

            <p>
                On October 4, 2004, Rev. Lonzo L. Hamilton, Sr. was elected and installed as pastor. 
                Under his leadership, the church purchased property across the street to be 
                used as a much-needed parking lot. Despite the devastation caused by 
                Hurricane Katrina, St. Matthew endured. 
                Though members were displaced and the church building suffered damage, 
                the congregation remained united. Through dedication and hard work, 
                the church reopened for worship in February 2006 while renovations 
                continued. St. Matthew has remained a beacon of light and hope in the community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under Pastor Hamilton's leadership, the church has prospered spiritually, 
                financially, and numerically. 
                In 2010, Deacon Robert L. Chandler, Jr. was licensed to preach, and in 2012, 
                he was ordained into the ministry. In 2017, plans were made to expand the church, 
                and construction of an additional building was completed in February 2019, with a 
                dedication service held on March 17, 2019. Today, St. Matthew Missionary Baptist 
                Church continues to stand firm—built on Christ the Solid Rock—serving God faithfully 
                and ministering to the community after more than eight decades of continuous service.
