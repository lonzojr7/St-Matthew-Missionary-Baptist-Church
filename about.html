        <p> 
            At St. Matthew Missionary Baptist Church, our faith is rooted in the Word of God and centered on Jesus Christ. 
            We believe the Bible is the foundation for our faith, our teaching, and our daily living.
            We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, divinely inspired and without error. It reveals God's truth, His will for humanity, and His plan of salvation. The Bible has God as its Author and serves as our final authority in matters of faith and practice.
            We believe in one faith, one Lord, and one baptism. We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins and rose again so that all who believe in Him may have eternal life.
            We believe in the security of the believer, trusting that salvation is a gift from God and that those who place their faith in Jesus Christ are kept by His grace and power.
            We believe in the return of Jesus Christ. We believe in the rapture of the church and in the second coming of Christ, when He will return in glory to fulfill God's promises and establish His eternal kingdom.
            Our beliefs guide how we worship, serve, and love others. We strive to live out our faith through prayer, discipleship, and service to our community, always seeking to glorify God in all that we do.
